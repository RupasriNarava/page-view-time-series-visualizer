# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.  
It focuses on visualizing time series data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.

## Project Description

The dataset contains the number of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp forum from May 2016 to December 2019.  
The goal is to clean the data and create the following visualizations:

1. Line Plot – Daily page views over time
2. Bar Plot – Average monthly page views grouped by year
3. Box Plots – Distributions of page views by year and by month to show trends and seasonality
